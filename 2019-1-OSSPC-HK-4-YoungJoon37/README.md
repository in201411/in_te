### **What Do We Improve?**

Our main goal was to make an original Tetris into a real-life game. A Tetris game we were given did not have any sound effect or visual effect. While playing the original one, we easily get bored of playing it. Regardless, it was a remarkable result from our senior students. We want to add a few functions to make it look like a real game. Here are what we have improved.

   

### **1. Background music and Sound Effect**

   We put background music and some sound effect such as when lines get removed when you click the button with your mouse and when the game ends. But to those who want to listen to music while playing, we made checkboxes. Therefore, you can turn it on/off when you feel like it.

###  **2. Multi-Play Window**

  This new function is the one we desperately wanted and worked on it. And we nailed it. When launched, the game used to have a single window even though we were able to play with your friend.

 It was a huge leap then. But we wanted to take it even further than that. We are proudly presenting OUR TOTALLY NEW       BREATHTAKING MULTI-WINDOW.


### **3. Visual Effects**
  What is even better about our game is we put awesome gif files. These help you focus on the game or make you play another round. Visual Effects are shown when you win/lose and remove the line. In the meantime, a counterpart is going to see popup windows which we put annoying memes there.
